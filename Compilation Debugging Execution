## Compilation

Compiler can detect the following types of errors:

*Syntax errors  (semi-colon missing or use of a reserved keyword (such as 'class')).
*When we try to access a variable that is not in scope, for Ex.: trying to access to private fields in other classes.
   ........
Compiler, which generates a message indicating the type of error and the position in the source file where the error occurred
   
If the compiler detects any errors during compilation it will fail to build a new class file in Java.
